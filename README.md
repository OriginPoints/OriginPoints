I'm Origin, also known as (OriginPoints, indepth), and I'm a programmer.
If you'd want to commission me for something, simply add me on discord, which will be listed at the end of the portfolio.

Programming languages: Lua, Python, C++, and occasionally C#. 
I'm in demand for those scripting languages since I'm highly organized and competent when it comes to the preceding programming languages.

Message me at Origin#3312 if needed (via discord)
